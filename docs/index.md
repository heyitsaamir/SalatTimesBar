Simple Salat Times is a small menubar for Mac that displays the upcoming salat times.

# Features

Simple Salat Times keeps features to what is essential so that you can keep up with your prayers in a timely manner. It intentionally does not contain extra features for the sake of simplicity.

## Accurate Salat Times

Powered by the excellent [AlAthan api](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api), which is an actively supported API used by a miriad of prayer times apps out there. It supports a tremendous number of toggles and features. This app only exposes a number of them, but if you feel like it's lacking, please feel free to post an [issue](#issues).

### Native Look & Feel

The app follows Apple's guidance on clean, simple design and style. It supports both light and dark mode.

### Introduce more simplicity as needed

You can choose how long you would like the salat label to be

### Notifications

Not enabled by default, but if you choose, you can enable notifications to alert you when the salat time comes and also when the next one will begin.

# Why?

I'm a developer and I wanted to learn SwiftUI. This seemed like a simple and yet very helpful project to help me do that.
