Simple Salat Times is a delightful menubar app for Mac that keeps you connected with your prayer times in a clean, native interface. 🕌

# Features ✨

Simple Salat Times focuses on what truly matters, helping you stay on track with your prayers in a timely manner. We've kept it intentionally simple and focused.

## Accurate Salat Times 🕋

Powered by the excellent [AlAthan API](https://aladhan.com/prayer-times-api), which is an actively supported API trusted by countless prayer times apps. It supports a wide range of features, and while we've kept it simple, we're always open to suggestions! Feel free to post an [issue](#issues) if you have ideas for improvement.

### Native Look & Feel 🎨

The app embraces Apple's design philosophy with a clean, simple interface that feels right at home on your Mac. It gracefully adapts to both light and dark mode.

As a developer passionate about learning SwiftUI, I created this app as a way to combine my technical interests with something meaningful. It's been a wonderful journey building something that helps others stay connected with their prayers.
